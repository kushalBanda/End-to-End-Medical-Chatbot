# Project Name: MedicoBot

### Overview
MedicoBot is designed to provide automated medical consultations, advice, and information. It leverages advanced AI and NLP technologies to understand and respond to a wide range of medical queries.

### Key Features
1. **Symptom Analysis**: Ability to analyze and interpret user-input symptoms.
2. **Medical Information**: Providing information on diseases, treatments, and medications.
4. **Emergency Handling**: Recognizing medical emergencies and advising immediate actions.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **LLMs (OpenAI)**: Utilizing models like GPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation.
- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: For efficient similarity search in large databases, useful in matching symptoms and conditions.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python, to create and manage the web server.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the frontend user interface.
- **JavaScript (Optional)**: For dynamic interactions on the frontend.
- **Database Management System**: For storing user data, medical information, etc.

### System Architecture
1. **Frontend**:
   - Interactive chat interface.
   - User authentication and profile management.
   - Responsive design for accessibility on various devices.

2. **Backend**:
   - Integration of LLMs for processing and generating responses.
   - FAISS for quick retrieval of relevant medical data.
   - APIs for interfacing with external medical databases or appointment systems.

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Secure handling and storage of personal medical data.
   - Privacy-compliant data management.

### Development Phases
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Understanding the scope and specific medical domain requirements.
2. **Design**: Architectural planning, UI/UX design.
3. **Development**:
